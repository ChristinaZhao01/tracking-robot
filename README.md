# Self-balancing Two-wheeled Tracking Robot

## Project contents

- Developed two-wheeled self-balancing tracking robot that transports table tennis balls to a specified location along a black line trajectory on the ground while maintaining stability.
- Adjusting the speed and attitude of the robot using PID control algorithms to prevent table tennis balls from falling off the robot.
- Calibrates and adjusts the sensitivity of the infrared sensors to ensure that the balancing robot accurately tracks the black line on the ground.
- Uses an innovative audio-visual alarm system that utilises diodes and buzzers to give an audible and visual alarm when it reaches a designated location.

## Programming Platform

 - Keil uVision5

## microcontroller
